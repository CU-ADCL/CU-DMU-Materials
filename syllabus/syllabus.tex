\section*{Websites}

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item \textbf{Canvas} will be the course hub.
    \item \textbf{Gradescope} will be used for all assignments and exams.
    \item {\textbf{Github}} will be used to host all public course materials at \url{https://github.com/CU-ADCL/CU-DMU-Materials}.
    \item \textbf{Ed} (\url{edstem.org}) will be used for discussions.
\end{itemize}

\end{samepage}

\section*{Attendance and Participation}

Learning is a collaborative effort between the instructor and students. If students are registered for the in-person section, they are expected to attend class and participate in discussions and exercises. Remote students are expected to watch the recorded lectures, ask questions on the discussion board if there is confusion, and monitor course announcements delivered via Canvas.

\section*{Assignments and Grading}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{35\% Homework Assignments.}
There will be 6 homework assignments, due approximately every two weeks. A typical assignment will consist of
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item Several conceptual questions or exercises.
    \item One open-ended programming problem. You solution will be evaluated locally with obfuscated code and the score submitted to a leaderboard. The best performers will share their solution in class.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{35\% Exams.}
There will be two in-class exams. The one with the higher score will be weighted 20\% and the one with the lower score will be weighted 15\%. Remote students can either attend class in-person on exam days or get a proctor, such as a supervisor at work, and take it remotely. Detailed instructions will be provided on Canvas.

\item \textbf{30\% Final Project.}
A final project chosen by the student that ideally connects to their research. Deliverable will be a 4-8 page report. Project may be completed in teams of up to 3.
\end{itemize}
As of the beginning of the course, participation is not expected to be a factor in assigning grades, however it may become a factor at the instructor's discretion. The class will be notified if participation from that point forward will be considered.
\end{samepage}

\subsection*{Late Policy}

To ensure proper progression through the course, students are expected to begin assignments early and submit homework assignments on time. However, in order to provide for minor unforeseen events or responsibilities, students may turn in late homework assignments within 72 hours of the due date with a 10\% penalty without any questions asked.

If a student has a special circumstance such as a major medical procedure, major family responsibility, or a religious observance that will prevent them from completing course work on time, this should be coordinated with the instructor well before the due date.

\subsection*{AI Policy}

I approach the class with the assumption that all students have a strong desire to learn rather than just to complete the assignments. In this course, you are highly-encouraged to use AI (specifically large language models such as Claude) as a \emph{learning tool}. You can ask it questions or have it assist in writing some code, but any prose or mathematical work that you turn in must be written by you, and any code must be written by or closely directed by you. You must understand everything that you turn in. This policy is difficult to enforce in homework, however, you will have to complete the exams without AI, so we trust that you will not violate it on the homework.
