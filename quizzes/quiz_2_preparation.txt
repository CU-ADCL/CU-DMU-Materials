Dear Class,

Quiz 2 will be a 105 minute timed at-home assessment administered through gradescope. The quiz will be available at 12 pm on Wednesday 3/30 and must be completed by 11:59 pm on Thursday 3/31.

You may use any static print or online resource, such as the textbook, Wikipedia, etc. However, you may not communicate with anyone other than me about the quiz during the time that it is available.

Topics covered will include

    Comparison and Classification of RL Algorithms (On-Policy/Off-Policy, Model-Base/Model-Free, Policy/Value learning)
    Bandits
    Fundamentals (e.g. update equations) of basic RL algorithms (Q-learning, SARSA, Policy Gradient, etc.)
    Basic knowledge of dense neural network function approximation (e.g. weights, biases, nonlinearities)
    DQN as implemented in HW5
    POMDP problem definitions
    Bayesian filters
    Alpha vectors (finite horizon, you will not have to perform a complete value iteration backup, but you should know how to draw alpha vectors for simple conditional plans and interpret them)
    Certainty equivalent and QMDP formulation approximations
    Weighted and unweighted particle filters
    History-space MCTS (aka POMCP, PO-UCT)

Study tools include (some of these problems would be too long for the quiz, but they are helpful for understanding):
