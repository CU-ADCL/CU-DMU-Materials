Write a short (less than 1 page, outline is ok) proposal for the Final
Project.

Working in a group of up to 3 is highly encouraged! You will submit a
single proposal for the entire group.

The proposal should contain the following:

1.  Problem Statement (e.g. rough formulation as MDP, POMDP,
    optimization problem, or game)

2.  Description of three levels of success for
    solving the problem:

    1.  A description of a **minimum working example** that will be the
        first thing you try. This might be a baseline to compare other
        approaches against. If you are not able to get this working, you
        will receive a significant grade penalty.

    2.  A description of the **main approach**. This is an approach that
        you are confident that you can implement and think will solve
        the problem well. I will expect to see this implemented
        successfully in your final report.

    3.  A description of a **stretch goal**. If you have enough time,
        this is the amazing innovative new solution you will explore.
