# Ideas for the final project

1. Apply a method from this class to a research problem that you are working on.
2. Create a long-horizon billiards shot engine https://youtu.be/vsTTXYxydOE (a previous student started a codebase here: https://github.com/donceykong/billiards-rl)
3. Create a (PO)MDP model of a skiing robot and find a decent descent solution.
4. Re-produce the results from a reinforcement learning paper and run at least one extra experiment that is not in the paper.
5. Build a DESPOT solver without determinization and compare it to the determinized version to quantify the value of determinization
6. Contribute a solver to POMDPs.jl or ReinforcementLearning.jl (a submission of this type should be able to reliably solve simple problems, conform to the interface, and have tests that pass)
7. Laser Tag Belief MDP (contact Himanshu Gupta)

You can also find examples in the [previous/projects directory](https://github.com/zsunberg/CU-DMU-Materials/tree/master/previous/projects/2022) in this repo or here: https://web.stanford.edu/class/aa228/cgi-bin/wp/old-projects/
