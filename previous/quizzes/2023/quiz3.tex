\begin{question} (20 pts)
    Consider a Markov game with two players, $\mathcal{I}=\{1,2\}$ and three states, $\mathcal{S}=\{1,2,3\}$. Each player can play $0$ or $1$, i.e. $\mathcal{A}^1 = \mathcal{A}^2 = \{0,1\}$. The game is zero sum, so $R^1(s, a) = -R^2(s, a)$. Player 2 gets a point if $s=2$, otherwise, there is no reward, i.e.
    \begin{equation}
        R^2(s, a) = \begin{cases}
            1 &\text{ if } s = 2 \\
            0 &\text{ otherwise.}
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
    The state deterministically transitions according to $s' = s + a^1 + a^2$ stopping at state $3$, that is
    \begin{equation}
        T(s' \mid s, a^1, a^2) = \begin{cases}
            1 &\text{ if } s' = \min(s + a^1 + a^2, 3) \\
            0 &\text{ otherwise,}
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
    and there is no discounting, $\gamma = 1.0$.
    Now suppose that Player 1 adopts a strategy $\pi^1$ that always plays $1$ in states $2$ and $3$, but plays 0 with $80\%$ probability in state 1.
    \begin{equation}
        \pi^1(a^1 \mid s) = \begin{cases}
            1 &\text{ if } s \in \{2, 3\} \text{ and } a^1 = 1 \\
            0.8 & \text{ if } s = 1 \text{ and } a^1 = 0 \\
            0.2 & \text{ if } s = 1 \text{ and } a^1 = 1 \\
            0.0 & \text{ otherwise.}
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
        \item If the current state is 1 and Player 1 plays according to $\pi^1$ and Player $2$ plays $a^2=1$, what is the probability that the next state will be 2?
        \item Describe in two steps how to find player 2's best response to $\pi^1$.
        \item Find player 2's best response to $\pi^1$ at state 1. (Hint: since neither player receives reward in state 3 and it is impossible to move out, state 3 can be considered terminal.)
    \end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\begin{question} (5 pts)
    Consider a two player Markov game and policy $\pi^1$ for player 1. Suppose that player 2 computes a best response to $\pi^1$ and call that policy $\pi^2$. Now, let $\pi^{1*}$ be a best response to $\pi^2$. Can we conclude that the joint policy $(\pi^{1*}, \pi^{2})$ is a Nash equilibrium? Why or why not?
\end{question}

\begin{question} (5 pts)
    Consider the extensive-form game tree discussed in class. Suppose that player 2 is not allowed to see \emph{any} cards, that is, he or she is dealt a card, but must keep it face down without looking. How would the extensive form game tree for this new game be different from the original game displayed below? You can draw or briefly describe your answer in words.

% \begin{question} (30 pts)
%     Consider a turn taking game where Player 1 (the maximizing player) chooses a number between 1 and 3 (i.e. 1, 2, or 3) then, after seeing Player 1's number, Player 2 also chooses a number between 1 and 3. If \emph{both} the sum of the two numbers \emph{and} the product of the two numbers are even, Player 2 wins, otherwise, Player 1 wins.
%     \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
%         \item Draw a minimax tree depicting this game labeled with payoffs.
%         \item Use minimax backup to calculate the values at each node and indicate them on the tree.
